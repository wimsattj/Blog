            </header>

            <p>A Mongolian man studied the ways of culture, war, and conquest, and came to a briliant conclusion... that a people who have no culture, or a weak culture, will not defend themselves against an invader. He also concluded, that when a culture is not rich in morality, or sence of duty to the past generations' way of life being preserved, those same peoples will welcome the ways of foreigners, and quickly forget their past, leaving them not just subject to the ways of the invader, but welcoming the new rules, or ways of life enforced by the invader. Perhaps even seeing the ways of the foreigner as <strong> liberating </strong>, and <strong>enlightening!</strong>
            </p>

            <p>On the contrary, those who's culture is firmly established, and to strictly adhered, Have no desire to bend to the will of others, if the others were to try to impose their <strong> foriegn </strong> thinking upon these natives. The natives with a strong moral character, will refuse to participate in behavior that destroys their way of life. These natives of strong moral fiber can easily identify the new strange behavior, <strong> and </strong> anticipate the <strong> damage </strong> this foreign behavoir will have on their way of life. Having done so, these strong willed natives will reject the ways of the foreigner, as disruptive, and distructive.

          <p>
            Now when Russia came on the scene, the ways and wisdom of the ancient Mongolain man came to the attention of those in power. They quickly decided to experiment with this concept of demoralizing an entire nation, for the purpose of weakening them, and making them easier to conquer. </p>
          <p>A man named Marx was hired by the russian government, to write a book. This book would be the cornerstone of the new religion of self-love, and endulgence. This book would teach the ways of violation of the law of the land, for the self-gratification of ones own selfish desires. These desires that violate the law, have many detrimental effects on the morality of the culture who's native tongue it was translated into, and <strong>yet sintilated</strong> the sences of the would be worshiper of this new selfish religion of self-love, being praised above all other things including <strong>Civility</strong>.

          <h3>Russia has been very sucessful... Recent Past.</h3>
          <p>After having translated this new powerfull tool in to many languages, Russia has gently introduced it's new religion into the children's library, of every nation that would accept it's book, including the United States. Many of the smaller countries have already been conquered after causing sufficient political unrest among the citizens who have read the book of Marx, and subscribed to it's self indulgent ways. Also causing the division between generations who had read the book, and those who had not. Also causing division between the government that enforced it's law to protect the people, and the Marxists that had abandoned the way of civility, and law.</p>

          <p>During the most recent worldwide epidemic known as <strong>Covid-19</strong>, the ancient wisdom "Those isolating themselves will seek their own selfish longing" was proved true. Marxism has exploded in all it's various forms. Worshiped by an ever increasing number of people having little patience for their kindred humans, this religion of self indulgence, motivates people to identify as that which they desire, no matter how destructive to their own mind and body.</p>
          <p>The people of the world, as a group, have abandoned all moral sence, seeking their own selfish longing, and abandoning Culture, Civilty, Civilized Behavior, Humaneness, Unselfish Love, and any sence of Love Of Family.</p>
          <h3>The Feilds Are Ripe... For Harvest.</h3>

          </div>
          <p>Now Begins the time of reckoning. Who has the good Moral sence to do what is best for the rest of mankind, and who has become so selfish that they have abandoned being identified as Human at all? Is all of humanity past all moral sence? If all the world has accepted the ways of Marxism, who will be conquered? What nation will rise above the others to take the Morally corupt, the weak, the selfish, and make them slaves to them? Who will be the victor? Who has maintained integrity amongst this wicked and twisted generation?</p>
          <p>Oh Yeah, in case you've dismissed what I'm writing as <strong><em>CRAZY</em></strong> or with the <strong><em>ravings of a lunatic mind</em></strong>, well, now, that is your subconscious mind trying to defend it's paradisaic version of reality, so check out this video from 1984...</p>
